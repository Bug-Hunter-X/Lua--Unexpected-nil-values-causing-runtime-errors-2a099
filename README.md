# Lua: Unexpected nil values causing runtime errors

This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming: unexpected nil values leading to runtime errors.

The `bug.lua` file contains code that calls a function with a nil value, causing an error.
The `bugSolution.lua` demonstrates a solution that handles nil values gracefully.

This is a simple example but illustrates a significant pitfall to be aware of when writing Lua code.  Proper error handling is crucial for robust applications.
